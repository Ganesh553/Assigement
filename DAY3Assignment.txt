	do 
	mv "$file" "${file}_$(date +"%d-%m-%Y")"; 
done

4) Print last 4 frequently access urls count in sortes order from /var/log/httpd/access.log
- $ cat access.log | awk '{print $11}' | sort -c | uniq | tail -4

5)print list of last 4 frequently access unique urls at particular hours from /var/log/httpd/access.log
- $ cat access.log | awk '{print $4" "$11}' | sort
 
6) Print list of web response code count in the unique sorted order at specific hour
- $ cat access.log | awk '{print $9, $10}' | sort -c | head -5

7) Print list of last 10 unique sorted IP from /var/log/httpd/access.log
- $ cat access.log | awk '{print $16}' | sort | uniq | tail -10

9) Check if a folder exists or not. IF it's not persent, creat it
- if [ -d "terminal_command/linux_terminal/" ]
  then
      echo "File exists."

      mkdir foldername
      echo "new Folder is created"
  fi

  export usersecreat="dH34xJaa23"

12) Find word "systemd" from all log file in the folder
-$ grep -x "systemd" /.../*.txt.

13) Create process list table display pid, ppid, common name, % of memory, % of cpu utilization
- $ ps -elf | awk '{print $2, $3, $6}'
 
12) Data analysis/manipulation (Awk)
i)- $cat data.csv | awk '{print $2,  $7, $4}'
ii)-$ cat data.csv | grep -i captain | awk '{sum+=$7} END {print sum/NR}'
iii)-$ cat data.csv | awk '{print $3, $5}'
iv)-$ cat data.csv | awk '{sum+=$4} END {print sum/NR}'

14) Find the difference between original file and the updated file. 
   Apply changes to the orignal file.
- mkdir orignal updated
 cp 'original-file.sh' orignal/
 cp 'updated-file.sh' updated/
 diff -qr orignal/ updated/
[-q the -q switch tells diff to report only when files differ.]
[-r switch to read the subdirectories as well]
